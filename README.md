# HypoxiaPerformancePredictor
HypoxiaPerformancePredictor is a machine learning model designed to predict the decline in maximal power output ($\Delta \text{POWER}_{\text{max}}$) in hypoxic conditions using physiological variables collected at sea level. The model was developed and validated on a dataset of human subjects exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (n=9).
